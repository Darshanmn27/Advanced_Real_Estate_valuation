# 🏡 Advanced Real Estate Valuation with Ensemble Regression Models

## 📌 About the Project

This project focuses on predicting **real estate prices** using **ensemble regression models** such as **Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost**. The model is trained on various property attributes like **location, size, number of rooms, and market trends** to provide an accurate valuation of properties.

## 📊 Features

✔️ Data Preprocessing & Cleaning\
✔️ Feature Engineering\
✔️ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\
✔️ Model Training with Multiple Regression Algorithms\
✔️ Performance Evaluation & Model Comparison\
✔️ Visualization of Predicted vs. Actual Prices

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn)
- **Machine Learning** (Regression Models, Feature Selection, Hyperparameter Tuning)
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Git & GitHub** for version control

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/real-estate-valuation.git
cd real-estate-valuation
```

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies

Make sure you have Python installed. Then, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3️⃣ Run the Jupyter Notebook

Start Jupyter Notebook and open the main project file:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Run all the cells to execute data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## 📈 Results & Insights

The project compares different regression models and evaluates their performance based on metrics such as:

- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
- **R² Score**

## 🔥 Future Enhancements

🔹 Adding Deep Learning models like ANN for valuation\
🔹 Improving feature selection techniques\
🔹 Deploying the model using Flask or FastAPI
